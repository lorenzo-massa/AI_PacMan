# Pac-Man AI Projects - University of Oulu

Welcome to the Pac-Man AI Projects repository, created as part of the coursework at the University of Oulu. This repository contains implementations of various AI techniques applied to solve challenges within the Pac-Man game environment. These projects are based on the original [Pac-Man AI Projects](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview) developed for UC Berkeley's CS 188 course.

## Overview

This project series covers fundamental AI concepts through engaging and interactive Pac-Man environments. The key topics and algorithms implemented include:

### Search Algorithms
Implementations of classic search algorithms:
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
- **A\* Search**

### Multi-Agent Search
Exploring adversarial and stochastic search problems by modeling classic Pac-Man as a multi-agent environment:
- **Minimax Algorithm**
- **Expectimax Algorithm**
- **Evaluation Functions**

## Project Goals
- **Visualization of AI Techniques:** Students can observe the outcomes of their implemented algorithms in a dynamic and interactive environment.
- **Hands-on AI Experience:** Provides practical experience with key AI algorithms, accompanied by clear instructions and examples.
- **Creative Problem Solving:** Pac-Man offers a challenging problem space that requires innovative solutions, preparing students for real-world AI challenges.

## Technical Details
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.10

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 installed on your system.
- Familiarity with basic Python programming and AI concepts.
